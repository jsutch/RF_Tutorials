# Notes about RF

These are notes related to RF, Power, and Antenna studies while I'm studying for an Amateur Extra class license. They're in markdown for clarity and pics and math symbols are supported.
Eventually I'll add jupyter notebooks related to NanoVNA use and antennas I build which use MathJax to express math symbols with better.

Please add comments or reach out to me if my notes could be improved or are incorrect in any way.

Mostly taken from the fantastic Rohde & Schwarz youtube channel.

### How to understand a Smith Chart.

The notes make the most sense if they're read (or viewed on youtube links in the notes) in this order:
- S Params
- VSWR
- Resistance/Reactance/Impedance (for a deeper dive or leave for later)
- Smith Charts

### formatting notes

The .md files are "Mostly Working" math/LaTeX to express the formulas, created in VSCode with MarkdownMath and LaTex. Unfortunately they don't fully express LaTeX/MathJax symbols in the way that MathJax does. Github doesn't express these at all, so raw output like $\Omega$ will display to show the Ohms symbol - better to clone and use your favorite .md/math setup. YMMV for your LaTeX/Math markdown interpreter.
